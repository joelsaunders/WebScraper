# WebScraper
Simple Web Scraper


This is a quick and dirty web scraper created in my spare time.

It is very specific and can only be used to scrape from the O2 website for landline rates.

Due to very limited time there are a few rules for use:

1. Initially it can only be used with Chrome

2. Secondly to use it you will have to make sure that the directory of your chromedriver is correct

3. Thirdly at the moment it takes input in the form of strings made up of letters, 
if the country name is incorrect or not on the website then there will be an Error and the program will crash.

I intend to improve this but have limited spare time at the moment due to large workload.
