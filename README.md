# WebScraper
Simple Web Scraper


This is a quick and dirty web scraper created in my spare time.

It is very specific and can only be used to scrape from the O2 website for landline rates.

Due to very limited time there are a few rules for use:

1. Initially it can only be used with Chrome

2. Secondly to use it you will have to make sure that the directory of your chromedriver is correct in the scraperprogram.py file

3. Thirdly at the moment it takes input in the form of strings made up of letters in a list form with entires separated by a comma and space e.g. South Africa, Croatia, Japan

4. It outputs a dictionary with country name and rate for landline calls

I really didn't manage to get much time to do this due to a very large workload, I intend to improve upon it.

I found the task very enjoyable.
